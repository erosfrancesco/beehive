Rude JS implementation of **ABC (Artificial Bee Colony)** algorithm ->[more info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_bee_colony_algorithm)
**Algorithm is still on development**


Provides a rude interface for searching and extracting food sources.

For now, new food sources are discovered randomly.
New candidates should be selected based on probability, but for now just the top ones are selected. Possible parameterizations.
